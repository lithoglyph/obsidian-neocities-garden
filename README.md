# Digital Obsidian Garden
This is the template to be used together with the [Digital Garden Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden). 
See the README in the plugin repo for information on how to set it up.

This fork is meant to deploy to neocities, so while you can still use it with the deploy to vercel button below, you will need to update `build.yml` to re-enable the build on main and disable the neocities build if you want to do that.
